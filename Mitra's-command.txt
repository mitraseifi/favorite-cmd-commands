"touch" is the easiest way to create new files, but it can also be used to change timestamps on files and/or directories. You can create as many files as you want in a single command without worrying about overwriting files with the same name.
mkdir is a useful command you can use to create directories. Any number of directories can be created simultaneously which can greatly speed up the process.
pwd is used to print the current directory you’re in. As an example, if you have multiple terminals going and you need to remember the exact directory you’re working within, then pwd will tell you.
